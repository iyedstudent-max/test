		 	Dear Future wife. 
		 	<br>
		 	You—yes, you, with your shy <span class="word"> smile </span> and those enchanting dark <span class="word"> eyes </span> captivate me endlessly.		 	<br>
		 	Every little thing about you, from your adorable  <span class="word"> laugh </span> to your delicate  <span class="word"> hands </span> from your <span class="word"> glasses </span> to that irresistible<span class="word">  scent </span> that follows you like magic, makes my heart flutter.
		 	<br>
		 	Even in moments when the world weighs heavy upon you, even at your lowest, you remain the <span class="word"> gorgeous queen </span> I’ve always known and adored. Your strength and resilience shine through, making you even more beautiful in my eyes.
		 	<br>
		 	You are my joy, my laughter, my secret happiness. 
			<br>
		 	Every glance, every word, every little quirk of yours I cherish like the rarest spell. You are utterly, completely… irresistibly you.
			<br>
			You can't imagine how much euphoric i am just thinking about you and that we just had our 3rd year toghether even though we were apart for a year . but i'm delighted that i entered the new year with you by my side 
		 	<br>
		 	So please , my darling stick there tight because i will never ever let you go .
			<br>
		 	<br>
		 	Your Enchanted One.
