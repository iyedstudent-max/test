LOVE—LOVE written in the quiet corners of my soul, LOVE pressed into every breath I take, LOVE repeated because once is never enough when it comes to you, my sweet darling. LOVE found me gently, and it never let go.

LOVE is years of choosing you, my love, and still wishing for more time than the world allows. LOVE is the way your presence feels like home, like warmth on a cold evening, like a soft spell I would never undo.

LOVE lives in every thought of you—cherished like a promise, held like something sacred. LOVE is how even silence feels full when I’m with you, my sweety, my darling, my forever.

LOVE is knowing that if my life were written on old parchment, your place in it would be inked deep and true, impossible to fade. LOVE is fate guiding me back to you, again and again, as if magic itself willed it so.

LOVE is what I give you freely and endlessly—today, tomorrow, and in every chapter still unwritten.

LOVE, always yours 🤍			<br>
			Love,
			<br>
          	<br>- Youda -
